# How to groom

Hemlock hates being groomed but can be bribed with treats. Juniper sometimes protests but she’s much easier. Make sure you give treats when the cats tolerate it well but not when they try to scratch or run away.

## Brushing

Brush the cats a little every day. Juniper it okay with brushing except around her back legs. Hemlock might try to scratch and/or bite you. Try brushing him when he is sleepy. You can also try wrapping him in a blanket so he can’t scratch you.

Types of brush:
- Plastic brush. This is the most gentle.
- Metal comb. This is good for de-tangling.
- Double-sided wire/bristle brush. The wire side gets out loose hair but can be rough.
- De-matting comb. This is great for de-tangling and removing loose hair. It doesn't really remove tough mats.

Most of the time I use the de-matting comb.

If the cats are really in a bad mood about it, try again another time.

## Mats

If you find a mat that you can't comb out, you have to cut it out. For this use the scissors or the trimmer. With the scissors be very careful that you don't cut the skin.

## Trimming

I trim around the bum and paws to stop litter getting stuck. If they get feces stuck to their bum-fur you will have to clean it with a pet wipe/baby wipe.
