# How to feed and water

Each cat eats up to 350 g per day. They might eat less when the weather is warm or when they have not exercised much.

Hemlock is greedy and Juniper is picky. Hemlock sometimes tries to eat Juniper’s food as well as his, especially if he really likes the food. Make sure Juniper also gets to eat.

You can use the slow feeders to make sure Hemlock doesn't eat too fast.

## Normal feeding schedule

| TIME  | AMOUNT PER CAT | FOOD TYPE |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| 07:30 | 100 g          | Wet food |
| 16:00 | 100 g          | Wet food |
| 20:00 | 100 g          | Wet food |
| 23:00 | 50 g           | Dry food |

## The food supply

### Wet food

Each day we go through 1 x 200 g tin of wet food and 1 x 400 g tin of wet food. This of course adds up to 600 g for both cats.

The usual brands are
- Wild Freedom
- Rosie's Farm
- MAC's.

### Dry food

Use the measuring cup to scoop out approx. 100 g of dry food and divide it between the two bowls.

The usual brands are
- Josera Nature
- Concept for Life Maine Coon.

## Autofeeder

You can use the autofeeder if you are away from home during the feeding times.

The autofeeder is set to rotate to the next food bowl at 4:00, 8:00, 12:00, 4:00 and 8:00. For the late meal (23:00-00:00) you have to be there to refill the autofeeder and/or give the cats their dry food in a bowl.

* Put approximately 50 g of food in each compartment.

Do not leave food in the autofeeder for more than 12 hours (no more than 8 hours in warm temperatures). The food will go bad and the cats won’t eat it.

## Food preparation

The dishes and utensils for the cat food are in the big middle drawer. Please do not use human plates, utensils or tupperware for cat food.

1. Mash the wet food with the spoon, so it is easier to eat. In warm weather add a few drops of water.
2. Put the bowls on two separate trays. For the autofeeder put a placemat in front of the open compartment. This is for hygiene/easier clean-up.
3. Put the food in the corner of the dining room.
4. Scrape any leftover food from the tin into an ice-cream tub and store it in the fridge.

## Water

Water is given in a large ceramic bowl. The ceramic bowl is part of a water fountain, but the cats seem to prefer still water. 

The water bowl belongs in the kitchen on the side of the doorway where there is a plug socket.

* Wash and refill the water bowl once per day.
