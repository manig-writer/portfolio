# How to treat

Please do not give cats treats for no reason.

Cats get treats as rewards for example
* getting in the carrier
* good behaviour while being groomed
* putting on the harness
* meeting new people
* catching the prey toy (sometimes)
* doing a food puzzle.

The exception to this is cat milk. They can have a small amount of cat milk in a bowl to share. They will not drink a lot of it.

## Food puzzles

I like to give these to the cats to distract them while I focus on my work or if I have to leave the house for a long time. Hemlock is very engaged and knows how to do them. Juniper doesn’t quite understand them but will watch and see if she can get any treats that fall out.

There are a few types of food puzzles:
- Ball with holes in it. Rolling the ball makes the treats come out.
- Dispenser on the small cat tree. Pulling on the ball and strings makes the treats fall out.

For these food puzzles the small, hard, square treats like Dreamies work best.

## Plants

Juniper really likes cat grass. It is a good idea to occasionally put the cat grass on a high shelf for a day, so it can recover.
Make sure Juniper does not eat any other plants.

## Supplements

Now and then I give the cats about 1 cm of anti-hairball paste. Juniper likes it. Hemlock usually won’t eat it. Since the dry food has anti-hairball properties, it is not necessary to give it.
