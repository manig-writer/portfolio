# How to play

## Play-hunting

Play with a fishing-rod/teaser toy for at least 15 minutes every day. Both cats really enjoy it and, since they are indoor cats, it is important for them.

Juniper especially loves play-hunting and is very good at it, so don’t make it too easy for her! Hemlock likes to run around and watch but will often stay on the sofa. He needs some encouragement, so you can make it a little easier for him.

The fishing-rod toys are under the lid of the coffee table. Please put them back here when you finish playing with the cats. This is so they don’t lose interest in the toys and so they don’t get tangled in the toys when you are not there.

## Other toys

I leave some self-initiated toys lying around, like the balls and the electronic mouse. Sometimes they play with these when they are alone at home or during the night.
