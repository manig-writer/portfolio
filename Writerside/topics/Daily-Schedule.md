# Daily Schedule

So you have an idea of what to expect and what the cats might expect, here is our daily schedule.

## Morning

**7:30** - The cats have their wet-food breakfast.

**8:30-9:00** - I scoop out the litter tray.

If I'm working from home, I sit in my office and the cats usually join me. If they keep walking or sitting between me and the screen, I often take advantage of them and brush them.

## Afternoon

**16:00** - The cats have their wet-food afternoon meal.

We have a 10-15 minute play session either before their meal or while I am cooking my dinner.

## Evening

**19:00** - The robot vacuum goes off.

**20:00** - Cats get their wet-food dinner. The water bowl is refreshed.

**23:00** - I scoop the litter box. Cats get their dry food. I (optionally) prepare the autofeeder for the next day.
