# How to litter

The litter boxes are in the small WC room. Scoop the litter once in the morning and once in the evening. 

1. Use the small spade to scoop out urine clumps and feces.
2. Flush them down the toilet - you should flush multiple times, so it doesnâ€™t get clogged. 
3. Wipe the scoop with disinfectant or wash it with soap after use.

Occasionally a cat might go outside of the box or on the edge of the box. There are dog-poo bags in the bottom drawer of the dining room cabinet. Use these to dispose of the waste. Clean the area with disinfectant.
