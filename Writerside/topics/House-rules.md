# House Rules

Juniper and Hemlock are indoor cats. They have been outside on a harness, but they don’t particularly like going outside, so don’t bother with it.

## Doors
- I keep the bedroom doors closed and other inner doors open. Occasionally I let them into the bedrooms. If you want to you can leave your bedroom door open. Please keep my bedroom door closed.
- Juniper sometimes dashes out the apartment door if she can get away with it. You have to watch her.

## Windows
- You can leave the windows on a tilt because the gap is too high up and the cats can’t fit through the gap.
- You can occasionally open the windows wide so the cats can sit on the ledge and look out but supervise them during this time! Do not leave the windows wide open when you go out of the flat.
- Keep the window in the litter room open to reduce the smell from the litter boxes.
- If it rains heavily, close the windows in both bathrooms so the floor doesn’t get wet.

## Surfaces
- The cats are not allowed on the kitchen counters or island counter. However, they will jump there when you are not looking. If you see them there, chase them off immediately.

## Bathroom
- Keep the shower doors and toilet lids closed when not in use.
