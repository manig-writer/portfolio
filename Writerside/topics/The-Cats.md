# The Cats

I adopted Juniper and Hemlock in July 2023.

They came to me through a charitable organization called Die Vergessenen (<https://www.die-vergessenen.org/>), whose mission it is to move cats and dogs from overflowing shelters in Poland to loving homes in Germany.

They are not siblings but have known each other most of their lives.
