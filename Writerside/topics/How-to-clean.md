# How to clean

## Feeding area

Please clean the feeding corner with a disposable wipe once a day.

Trays, feeding mats and the autofeeder (if used) need to be washed at least once a day. Use clean food bowls for each meal.

## Litter area

If litter is spreading out of the litter room, sweep it with the broom/dustpan and brush. Shake the litter mats into the litter boxes.

Disinfect the scoop after each use. Use the disinfectant wipes to clean up any messes on the outside of the litter boxes or around the litter boxes.

## Robot vacuum

The robot vacuum cleaner is programmed to run at 19:00 every day. It is not a smart device â€“ it goes around randomly and bounces off objects. It does a light clean to collect litter and fur.

If you plan to go out during this time, please switch off the robot vacuum (red switch underneath).

Make sure that the food bowls, food trays, cat toys and similar items are not on the floor while the robot vacuum is running. Low-lying items can get stuck under the vacuum. If something gets stuck, you may need to detach the spinning brushes or rolling brush to remove it.

The robot vacuum may get stuck on the litter mats. If this happens, remove it from the mat, put it outside the litter room and press start again.

You do not need to bring the robot vacuum on the stair or into the bedrooms.

You can stop (top button) the robot vacuum after about 30-45 minutes or whenever you think it has covered the apartment. Return the robot vacuum to the charging stand.

Empty the dust compartment every 1 to 2 days. You may also need to remove hair and fur from around the brushes.

## Soft surfaces

Use a lint roller or the soft side of the double-sided hairbrush to clean fur from the sofa and blankets.
